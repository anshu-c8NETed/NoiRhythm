**Step 1: Organize Your Music Files**

For each playlist folder, add:

A cover image (JPG/PNG format recommended)
All songs belonging to that playlist



**Step 2: Update HTML Cards**

Open your HTML file and locate the <div class="card-container"> section
For each playlist card:

Update/Replace the <img src=""> attribute with your cover image filename
Modify the <div data-folder=""> attribute with your exact playlist folder name


*Ensure the folder names match exactly between your file system and HTML code*

**Step 3: Dynamic Loading**
The JavaScript code will automatically:

*Detect your playlist folders*
Load songs from each folder
Display them in the corresponding cards

**Step 4: Launch & Enjoy**
